# bio: "Cheng-Yu (Mike) Tsai is a first-year PhD student at Georgia Tech ECE. Generally, his interest is to accelerate the performance of a system with systematic, explainable approach, or to develop tools facilitate this goal. His MS thesis is about a performance analytical model which enables design space exploration (DSE) of cache design and understanding of workload characteristics. During his work at TSMC, he always actively seeks for chances to leverage parallel programming, sparsity, reducing software stack, etc., to improve the performance of tasks"
bio: "Cheng-Yu (Mike) Tsai is a first-year PhD student at GTCAD Lab supervised by Dr. Sung-Kyu Lim in Georgia Tech ECE. Before joining the GTCAD lab, he worked at TSMC's custom design flow team for three years, where the mission was to develop tools embedded in PDK or cooperate with EDA companies for new features to facilitate customers' design efforts. He earned a master's degree in computer science at National Taiwan University (NTU) and double majored in electrical engineering and computer science at NTU for his bachelor's degree. His MS thesis is about a performance analytical model enabling design space exploration (DSE) of cache design and understanding workload characteristics."
