This part of experience is too broad to be covered in a page and is thus divided into several subsections.


- [Photography](./EQTeam/photography.html): includes the photos I have taken for this team/club.
- [Video Recording](./EQTeam/video.html): includes the videos I was in charge of (recording or editing)
- [Lighting](./EQTeam/lighting.html): includes the lighting demonstration photos and videos.
- [Training](./EQTeam/training.html): includes the lectures and handouts I designed to train the newcomers.
